It can be combined with verbs like 'seem to be' or 'appear to be'.\n\n* The pronoun [It] is a referential pronoun, meaning it must refer back to a specific noun already mentioned (e.g., 'I see a bug. It seems serious.'). In this sentence, no specific 'problem' has been introduced yet, so we use 'There' to state its existence."

'Got' by itself is technically the simple past tense of 'get'."

    "note": "You were absolutely right, this card was flawed as it previously had two correct answers. I have completely reworked it to use a pronoun ('it'), which makes the correct word order unambiguous. This now correctly tests the rule for separable phrasal verbs with pronouns."
